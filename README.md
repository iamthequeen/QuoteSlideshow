Project is created with:


-  HTML

-  CSS

-  jQuery



## Features

## Challenges




-  Looping the slideshow (so when it gets to the last slide, it goes back to the first slide)

-  Responsive images (when the screen width is small enough, there are a different set of quotes since those images are a smaller size.)




## Inspiration

I chose to incorporate quotes in my slideshow because sometimes people need a pick-me-up! Mental health is very important and with situations that go on in peopleâ€™s lives, they tend to forget the little things so this slideshow is a reminder for those who are going through rough times or need a little motivation!
